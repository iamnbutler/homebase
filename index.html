            <p>I’m not sure if you want to use my terrible code as a reference, but you can see what I have here! github.com/iamnbutler/h...</p>

            <p>maybe some software is just complete. it doesn’t need anymore features.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>heh, I did actually end up going back and trying this. It is a bit wild...</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>this shouldn't be novel but... imagine just being able to just fetch your posts? ❌🐦</p>

            <p>Oh yeah, that makes sense. I was going to say, on average I’d take most rust docs over ts docs any day 😜</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>I've never had anything but great experiences with Rust docs! What were you trying to do?</p>

            <p>I assume you know about our vscode key map? So you want to be able to take your settings.json from vscode and map it to anything that is relevant in Zed?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>By optional tree view you mean being able to see your changed nested in a filetree? If so, don’t worry, we are working on that 🙂</p>
        </li>

            <p>I've tried it. I could get used to it... I think they are doing a good thing, but I don't think I'd commit to and deeply learn any application that wasn't files-on-disk first anymore.

There is literally no reason design files need to be on the internet.</p>

            <p>I feel this. Any time I’ve come back to my next site to work on it I’ve spent 1-2hrs combatting errors, broken packages, etc. 

it feels great for creating in the moment, but far less so for anything that will live longer and you maintain yourself.</p>
