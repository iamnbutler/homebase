    <h1>My Blue Sky Posts</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>I’m not sure if you want to use my terrible code as a reference, but you can see what I have here! github.com/iamnbutler/h...</li>
        <li>maybe some software is just complete. it doesn’t need anymore features.</li>
        <li>heh, I did actually end up going back and trying this. It is a bit wild...</li>
        <li>this shouldn't be novel but... imagine just being able to just fetch your posts? ❌🐦</li>
        <li>Oh yeah, that makes sense. I was going to say, on average I’d take most rust docs over ts docs any day 😜</li>
        <li>I've never had anything but great experiences with Rust docs! What were you trying to do?</li>
        <li>tfw 😩</li>
        <li>I assume you know about our vscode key map? So you want to be able to take your settings.json from vscode and map it to anything that is relevant in Zed?</li>
        <li>By optional tree view you mean being able to see your changed nested in a filetree? If so, don’t worry, we are working on that 🙂</li>
        <li>I've tried it. I could get used to it... I think they are doing a good thing, but I don't think I'd commit to and deeply learn any application that wasn't files-on-disk first anymore.

There is literally no reason design files need to be on the internet.</li>
        <li>how my day is going</li>
        <li>Things are coming along for git ui 😁 #zed</li>
        <li>Who has the best version control icons?

We are working on git ui for @zed.dev right now and I'd love to make sure our icons are clear and meaningful.</li>
        <li>Congrats! 🔥</li>
        <li>was in my first 🚗 accident (where I was driving) 🫣 Icy roads are no joke 💀 luckily no one else was involved!</li>
        <li>(Serious) Have you every talked to someone about a potential ADHD diagnosis? 

If not ADDitude might be a good place to start: www.additudemag.com/symptom-chec...</li>
        <li>@zed.dev!</li>
        <li>high quality notifications 👍</li>
        <li>I feel this. Any time I’ve come back to my next site to work on it I’ve spent 1-2hrs combatting errors, broken packages, etc. 

it feels great for creating in the moment, but far less so for anything that will live longer and you maintain yourself.</li>
        <li>I swear if I’m still paying figma at the end of the year next year I’ll lose my god damn mid</li>
        <li>2025 goal: reduce software subscriptions to $0, support more folks making pay-to-own software!</li>
        <li>I'm on a Design Advisory Board for Canva, and I want to get professional creative community feedback about how to improve their products and what the general vibe / concerns are. Help me bring your hopes/dreams/concerns to our next meeting by filling this out!

        <li>Snagged one ✌️ these are so cool</li>
        <li>Canada general 😭</li>
        <li>It’s even cooler that she is an engineer too! Which is didn’t know until recently.</li>
        <li>Dangerous thoughts ✨</li>
        <li>Recent obsession: Watching literally every video on this channel. I wonder if I could fit a lathe in [insert every room in my house]...

        <li>First time hacking in svelte tonight. It is pretty fun so far :) Any big svelte tips or gotchas?</li>
        <li>🐟 some musings on how we might use LLMs
