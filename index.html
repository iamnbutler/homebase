            <p>maybe some software is just complete. it doesn’t need anymore features.</p>

            <p>Oh yeah, that makes sense. I was going to say, on average I’d take most rust docs over ts docs any day 😜</p>

            <p>I've never had anything but great experiences with Rust docs! What were you trying to do?</p>

            <p>I've tried it. I could get used to it... I think they are doing a good thing, but I don't think I'd commit to and deeply learn any application that wasn't files-on-disk first anymore.

            <p>I feel this. Any time I’ve come back to my next site to work on it I’ve spent 1-2hrs combatting errors, broken packages, etc.
